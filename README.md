A basic TextMate theme, also suitable for use in Aptana v3+ or any other editor that uses `.tmTheme` files.

As most developers, I am pretty particular about my IDE's visual appearance. After upgrading to Aptana 3, which switched from Eclipse-style settings to using TextMate themes, I was desperately in need of a new editor theme. I needed something light-on-dark that provided decent styling for at least the following syntaxes:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- PHP
- JSON
- XML
- Markdown

The closest I found to what I wanted was [Tubster](https://github.com/filmgirl/TextMate-Themes/blob/master/Tubster.tmTheme), though it wasn't quite perfect for me. The biggest issue out of the box was missing support for Markdown styling. For that I copied in the Markdown style rules from [Sunburst](http://projects.serenity.de/textmate/). Finally I tweaked a few things here and there to my personal liking, resulting in my custom theme Skew Mellow.
